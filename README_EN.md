# Sensor Simulator

A sensor simulator for generating realistic measurements from defined trajectories. The simulator supports multiple sensor types: IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), odometer, barometer, and magnetometer.

## Description

Sensor Simulator allows you to generate simulated sensor data from a user-defined trajectory. This trajectory can be:
- **Simulated**: manually defined or generated by the user
- **Real**: imported from real trajectory data (planned feature)

The generated measurements include noise, drift, and other realistic sensor characteristics to enable the development and testing of navigation, filtering, and sensor fusion algorithms.
